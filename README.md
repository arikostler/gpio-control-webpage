One of my first raspberry pi gpio "smart home" webpages. I believe this is the second version. Version 1 was written for a homework assignment while I was attending college and version two was a recreation written in 2015 to use in my home to turn on/off a fan and a lamp. This was before I discovered HomeAssistant and just wanted to control relays fom my phone.

I would very much not recommend using this code in any public way or as a reference for how to do perform these actions in a modern way as it was one of my first web projects ever and is very insecure.
